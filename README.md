# MTMF-GIFs
The optimal robot designs obtained by genetic algorithm(GA), compositional pattern producing network (CPPN-NEAT), individual-based multi-fidelity optimization algorithm (MTMF-OA-ind), generation-based multi-fidelity optimization algorithm (MTMF-OA-gen) and morphological transfer-based multi-fidelity optimization algorithm (MTMF-OA) in five independent runs.

The simulation animation and rewards have been placed in EasyTasks.md, MediumTasks.md, and HardTasks.md.

The loading speed of the above three pages is slightly slow, please be patient. Thank you!

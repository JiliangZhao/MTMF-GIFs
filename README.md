# MTMF-GIFs
The optimal robot designs obtained by genetic algorithm(GA), compositional pattern producing network (CPPN-NEAT), individual-based multi-fidelity evolutionary algorithm (MTMFEA-ind), generation-based multi-fidelity evolutionary algorithm (MTMFEA-gen) and morphological transfer-based multi-fidelity evolutionary algorithm (MTMFEA) in five independent runs.

The simulation animation and rewards have been placed in EasyTasks.md, MediumTasks.md, and HardTasks.md.
